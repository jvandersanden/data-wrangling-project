My project for Data Wrangling, finished on 12/16

Goals:

Scrape Amazon's Website to get data on books that have sold the best historically. Then analyze if they sell just as well online through Amazon.

Data:

1. Best Selling Books: Comes from Kaggle and shows past data of book sales
2. Amazon Raw: Scraped data from Amazon's website for every book in "Best Selling Books"

Timeline:

This was all done between November and December of 2024.
